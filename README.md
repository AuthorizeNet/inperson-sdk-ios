#Authorize.Net In-Person SDK for iOS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ios)

The iOS SDK provides a fast and easy way for iPhone/iPad application developers to quickly integrate mobile payment without having to write the network communication, XML generation/parsing, and encoding of the data to the Authorize.Net gateway.


## Try It

If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) you can try our sample app with just a single command:

````
   $ pod try 'authorizenet-sdk'
````
 
## Installation
Installation is very simple with Cocoapods but you can also install manually.

#### Including our CocoaPod

1. Add our pod to your project Podfile:

        pod 'authorizenet-sdk'

1. Then run `pod install` or `pod update`

2. If you are running `pod install` for the first time you'll be reminded to always use the .xcworkspace file for your project rather that the xccodeproj

1. NOTE: You may need to add libxml2.dylib to "Link Binary with Libraries" build phase.



#### Including the SDK manually

1. Download the zip file of the SDK from `https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/inperson-sdk-ios/archive/master.zip` and unzip to your preferred location.
2. In XCode, select your project in Project Navigator and select File->Add Files to "" from the main menu bar.
3. In the file dialog, select the sdk folder from the unzipped directory in Step 1.
4. In the file dialog, make sure "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" is checked and click Add button.



# Building an MPoS Application

##Overview

The Authorize.Net SDK provides support for four main feature areas of an MPoS solution:

1. Mobile Device Registration & Login
2. Transaction Processing
3. Customer Email Receipt
4. Transaction Reporting


## Mobile Device Registration & Login


###Register Device

*Each device to be used for MPoS transactions must be registered (see SDK support below) and approved by the merchant (in the MINT) before that device can be used for transaction processing.*

```objective-c
/**
* Perform mobileDeviceRegistrationRequest on the AIM API.
* @param r The request to send.
*/
- (void) mobileDeviceRegistrationRequest:(MobileDeviceRegistrationRequest *) r;
```

Perform an mobileDeviceRegistrationRequest request.  Application can still receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

### Merchant User Login

*If the device is registered and approved then it can create a session for the user by "loggin on" to the Anet API:*

```objective-c
/**
* Perform mobileDeviceLoginRequest on the AIM API.
* @param r The request to send.
*/
- (void) mobileDeviceLoginRequest:(MobileDeviceLoginRequest *)r;
```

Perform an mobileDeviceLoginRequest request.  Application can still receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

### Merchant User Logout
*
To ensure maximum security the user should "logout" from their session and subsequently the application should use this method to terminate the mobile API session.*

```objective-c
/**
* Perform logoutRequest on the AIM API.
* @param r The request to send.
*/
- (void) LogoutRequest:(LogoutRequest *)r;
```

Perform an LogoutRequest request.  Application can still receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.


## Transaction Processing

The SDK includes APIs for each of the supported API methods: 

1. AUTH
1. PRIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE
1. CAPTURE
1. VOID
1. CREDIT
1. CAPTURE_ONLY
1. Unlinked CREDIT

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform AUTH transaction with request.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) authorizeWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a AUTH request. Application will receive delegate call back 
for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting 
the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform AUTH_CAPTURE transaction with request.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) purchaseWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a AUTH_CAPTURE request.  Application will receive delegate call 
back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting 
the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform PRIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE transaction with request.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) captureWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a PRIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE request.  Application can still receive delegate call 
back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting 
the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform CAPTURE_ONLY transaction with request.
 * NOTE: Request must include in the request the authCode (x_auth_code).
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) captureWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a PRIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE request.  Application can still receive delegate 
call back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the 
UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform VOID transaction with request.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) voidWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a VOID request.  Application can still receive delegate call 
back for successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by 
setting the UIViewController with the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform CREDIT transaction with request.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) creditWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform a CREDIT request.  Application can still receive delegate call back for successful, 
failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the UIViewController with 
the setDelegate call.

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform unlinked CREDIT transaction with request.
 * NOTE: Unlinked Credit request must not have an transaction id (x_trans_id) value.
 * @param r The request to send.
 */
- (void) unlinkedCreditWithRequest:(AuthNetAIMRequest *)r;
```

Perform an unlinked CREDIT request without using the UIButton call 
back mechanism.  Application can still receive delegate call back for 
successful, failed, and canceled transaction flows by setting the UIViewController 
with the setDelegate call.


## Customer Email Receipt


```objective-c
/**
* Perform sendCustomerTransactionReceiptRequest on the AIM API.
* @param r The request to send.
*/
- (void) sendCustomerTransactionReceiptRequest:(SendCustomerTransactionReceiptRequest *) r;
```

## Reporting

```objective-c
/**
 * Perform getSettledBatchListRequest on the Reporting API.
 * @param r The reporting request to send.
 */
- (void) getBatchStatisticsRequest:(GetBatchStatisticsRequest *) r;
```

receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled 
transaction flows by setting the UIViewController 
with the setDelegate call.

 * Perform getTransactionDetailsRequest on the Reporting API.
 * @param r The reporting request to send.
 */
- (void) getTransactionListRequest:(GetTransactionListRequest *) r;
```

Perform an getTransactionListRequest request.  Application can still 
receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled 
transaction flows by setting the UIViewController 
with the setDelegate call.

receive delegate call back for successful, failed, and canceled 
transaction flows by setting the UIViewController 
with the setDelegate call.

#Putting it all together - the sample app

In order to help test for reachability on your device, you'll need to 
include the "SystemConfiguration.framework." From the Project Settings, 
go to the "Build Phases" tab and expose the "Link Binary With Libraries" 
section. Click the "+" button, select "SystemConfiguration.framework" and 
click "Add." The framework will be added to your project, which you may move 
to the "Frameworks" folder.

2) Initialize the singleton with the AUTHNET_ENVIRONMENT setting (dictating whether to access the
Test environment or the Live environment) either at the ApplicationDelegate or in the initial
UIViewController.  Make sure to #import "AuthNet.h".

```objective-c
[AuthNet authNetWithEnvironment:ENV_TEST];
```

3) Copy the code snippet below into your source file in XCode. Create a variable named "sessionToken" 
to store the session token and add your test credentials where <USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> are currently 
present. Then call the loginToGateway method from the appropriate class.

The example below is a minimal example of how to create and submit a transaction using the SDK:

```objective-c
- (void) loginToGateway {
    MobileDeviceLoginRequest *mobileDeviceLoginRequest =
        [MobileDeviceLoginRequest mobileDeviceLoginRequest];
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.name = <USERNAME>;
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.password = <PASSWORD>;
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.mobileDeviceId =
        [[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]
        stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"-" withString:@"_"];

    AuthNet *an = [AuthNet getInstance];
    [an setDelegate:self];
    [an mobileDeviceLoginRequest: mobileDeviceLoginRequest];
}

- (void) createTransaction {
    AuthNet *an = [AuthNet getInstance];

    [an setDelegate:self];

    CreditCardType *creditCardType = [CreditCardType creditCardType];
    creditCardType.cardNumber = @"4111111111111111";
    creditCardType.cardCode = @"100";
    creditCardType.expirationDate = @"1212";

    PaymentType *paymentType = [PaymentType paymentType];
    paymentType.creditCard = creditCardType;

    ExtendedAmountType *extendedAmountTypeTax = [ExtendedAmountType extendedAmountType];
    extendedAmountTypeTax.amount = @"0";
    extendedAmountTypeTax.name = @"Tax";

    ExtendedAmountType *extendedAmountTypeShipping = [ExtendedAmountType extendedAmountType];
    extendedAmountTypeShipping.amount = @"0";
    extendedAmountTypeShipping.name = @"Shipping";

    LineItemType *lineItem = [LineItemType lineItem];
    lineItem.itemName = @"Soda";
    lineItem.itemDescription = @"Soda";
    lineItem.itemQuantity = @"1";
    lineItem.itemPrice = @"1.00";
    lineItem.itemID = @"1";

    TransactionRequestType *requestType = [TransactionRequestType transactionRequest];
    requestType.lineItems = [NSArray arrayWithObject:lineItem];
    requestType.amount = @"1.00";
    requestType.payment = paymentType;
    requestType.tax = extendedAmountTypeTax;
    requestType.shipping = extendedAmountTypeShipping;

    CreateTransactionRequest *request = [CreateTransactionRequest createTransactionRequest];
    request.transactionRequest = requestType;
    request.transactionType = AUTH_ONLY;
    request.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.mobileDeviceId =
        [[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]
        stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"-" withString:@"_"];
    request.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.sessionToken = sessionToken;
    [an purchaseWithRequest:request];
}

- (void) requestFailed:(AuthNetResponse *)response {
    // Handle a failed request
}

- (void) connectionFailed:(AuthNetResponse *)response {
    // Handle a failed connection
}

- (void) paymentSucceeded:(CreateTransactionResponse *) response {
    // Handle payment success
}

- (void) mobileDeviceLoginSucceeded:(MobileDeviceLoginResponse *)response {
    sessionToken = [response.sessionToken retain];
    [self createTransaction];
};
```

4) The first time you execute this sample code from a new device (either real 
or virtual), you will notice that the loginToGateway call fails and states 
that the device has been registered but is pending approval. You will need to 
login to the sandbox (https://test.authorize.net/) and enable the new device. 
You can find this by going to:

Home > Account (Settings) > Security Settings (Mobile Device Management)

Once there, you should see your new device in a 'Pending' state. Click on the new device and enable it.

Execute the above sample code again and the transaction should succeed.

5) Verify payment transaction success on your transaction report.



**Detail of the Authorize.Net iOS SDK**
=============================================

```objective-c
/**
 * Initialization of the AuthNet Singleton with the development server type.
 * @param e The environment either live or test server.
 */
+(AuthNet *)authNetWithEnvironment:(AUTHNET_ENVIRONMENT)e;
```

A class method that initializes and returns a singleton instance of AuthNet module.

```objective-c
/**
 * Get reference to singleton.
 */
+(AuthNet *)getInstance;
```
