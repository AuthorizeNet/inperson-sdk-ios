iOS SDK
================

The iPhone SDK is meant to offer an alternate object-oriented model of
development with the Authorize.net APIs (Version 3.1).  The iPhone SDK
provides a fast and easy way for iPhone/iPad application developers to 
quickly integrate mobile payment without having to write the network
communication, XML generation/parsing, and encoding of the data to 
the Authorize.net gateway.

The SDK includes APIs for each of the supported API methods: 
1) AUTH
2) PIOR_AUTH_CAPTURE
3) CAPTURE
4) VOID
5) CREDIT
6) CAPTURE_ONLY
7) Unlinked CREDIT

The SDK also includes APIs for each of the following API methods: 
1)Reporting
	a) getBatchStatisticsRequest
	b) getSettledBatchListRequest
	c) getTransactionDetailsRequest
	d) getTransactionListRequest
	e) getUnsettledTransactionListRequest

2) Mobile Login and Registration.
	a) mobileDeviceLoginRequest
	b) mobileDeviceRegistrationRequest
	c)LogoutRequest

3) Customer Email Receipt
	a) sendCustomerTransactionReceiptRequest


NOTE: The SDK includes the static library located in ./ANMobilePaymentLib as well as the full source.  The static library can also be generated from source by running the build script, ./build.sh.  

Quick Example of the SDK to make a transaction with the
Authorize.Net payment gateway.
=============================================


1) Include all the header files and static library in your project.

In your project settings:

Set your Library Search Paths with the path that contains the "Authorize.Net SDK" 
library. (ex. "$(SRCROOT)/ANMobilePaymentLib").

Set your Other Linker Flags with "-lxml2" to allow for xml parsing.

Set your Header Search Paths with the path that contains "libxml2" header 
files. (ex. "/usr/include/libxml2" with recursive checked).

In order to help test for reachability on your device, you'll need to 
include the "SystemConfiguration.framework." From the Project Settings, 
go to the "Build Phases" tab and expose the "Link Binary With Libraries" 
section. Click the "+" button, select "SystemConfiguration.framework" and 
click "Add." The framework will be added to your project, which you may move 
to the "Frameworks" folder.

2) Initialize the singleton with the AUTHNET_ENVIRONMENT setting (dictating whether to access the
Test environment or the Live environment) either at the ApplicationDelegate or in the initial
UIViewController.  Make sure to #import "AuthNet.h".

[AuthNet authNetWithEnvironment:ENV_TEST];

3) Copy the code snippet below into your source file in XCode. Create a variable named "sessionToken" 
to store the session token and add your test credentials where <USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> are currently 
present. Then call the loginToGateway method from the appropriate class.

The example below is a minimal example of how to create and submit a transaction using the SDK:

- (void) loginToGateway {
    MobileDeviceLoginRequest *mobileDeviceLoginRequest =
        [MobileDeviceLoginRequest mobileDeviceLoginRequest];
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.name = <USERNAME>;
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.password = <PASSWORD>;
    mobileDeviceLoginRequest.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.mobileDeviceId =
        [[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]
        stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"-" withString:@"_"];

    AuthNet *an = [AuthNet getInstance];
    [an setDelegate:self];
    [an mobileDeviceLoginRequest: mobileDeviceLoginRequest];
}

- (void) createTransaction {
    AuthNet *an = [AuthNet getInstance];

    [an setDelegate:self];

    CreditCardType *creditCardType = [CreditCardType creditCardType];
    creditCardType.cardNumber = @"4111111111111111";
    creditCardType.cardCode = @"100";
    creditCardType.expirationDate = @"1212";

    PaymentType *paymentType = [PaymentType paymentType];
    paymentType.creditCard = creditCardType;

    ExtendedAmountType *extendedAmountTypeTax = [ExtendedAmountType extendedAmountType];
    extendedAmountTypeTax.amount = @"0";
    extendedAmountTypeTax.name = @"Tax";

    ExtendedAmountType *extendedAmountTypeShipping = [ExtendedAmountType extendedAmountType];
    extendedAmountTypeShipping.amount = @"0";
    extendedAmountTypeShipping.name = @"Shipping";

    LineItemType *lineItem = [LineItemType lineItem];
    lineItem.itemName = @"Soda";
    lineItem.itemDescription = @"Soda";
    lineItem.itemQuantity = @"1";
    lineItem.itemPrice = @"1.00";
    lineItem.itemID = @"1";

    TransactionRequestType *requestType = [TransactionRequestType transactionRequest];
    requestType.lineItems = [NSArray arrayWithObject:lineItem];
    requestType.amount = @"1.00";
    requestType.payment = paymentType;
    requestType.tax = extendedAmountTypeTax;
    requestType.shipping = extendedAmountTypeShipping;

    CreateTransactionRequest *request = [CreateTransactionRequest createTransactionRequest];
    request.transactionRequest = requestType;
    request.transactionType = AUTH_ONLY;
    request.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.mobileDeviceId =
        [[[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]
        stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"-" withString:@"_"];
    request.anetApiRequest.merchantAuthentication.sessionToken = sessionToken;
    [an purchaseWithRequest:request];
}

- (void) requestFailed:(AuthNetResponse *)response {
    // Handle a failed request
}

- (void) connectionFailed:(AuthNetResponse *)response {
    // Handle a failed connection
}

- (void) paymentSucceeded:(CreateTransactionResponse *) response {
    // Handle payment success
}

- (void) mobileDeviceLoginSucceeded:(MobileDeviceLoginResponse *)response {
    sessionToken = [response.sessionToken retain];
    [self createTransaction];
};

4) The first time you execute this sample code from a new device (either real 
or virtual), you will notice that the loginToGateway call fails and states 
that the device has been registered but is pending approval. You will need to 
login to the sandbox (https://test.authorize.net/) and enable the new device. 
You can find this by going to:

Home > Account (Settings) > Security Settings (Mobile Device Management)

Once there, you should see your new device in a 'Pending' state. Click on the new device and enable it.

Execute the above sample code again and the transaction should succeed.

5) Verify payment transaction success on your transaction report.
